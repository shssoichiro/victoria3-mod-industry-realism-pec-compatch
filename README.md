# Industry Realism + Political & Economic Changes Mod Compatch

![Preview](thumbnail.png)

**Tested With V3 Version: 1.10.0**

Compatibility patch between Industry Realism and Political & Economic Changes.

Note that this _excludes_ the PEC change to allow producing charcoal from logging camps. Charcoal is not suitable for use in steel, so it is not a suitable in-game substitute for coal in my opinion.
